# Search String
It is a Python script to search all the occurrences of a string (let's call it "search string") in all the files under a directory.

This script will search for the string ("search string") in all the files under all sub-directories.

Developed in Python 2.7, on a Raspberry Pi 3, Model B.

However, it will work on all machines with Ubuntu and similar OSs.
